### Hi there üëã
I'm Arash, I ‚ù§Ô∏é open source!

I am a passionate intermediate developer who knows Python and Javascript very well. I'm currently learning many different frameworks, but already know how to use some of them proficiently. ~~Among other things I try to get the Responsive Web Design Certificate from freeCodeCamp.org~~ [I got the certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/aramodi/responsive-web-design), but I'm still trying to get more.. I also participate in the [fork of Proton Native, called Valence Native](https://github.com/valence-native/valence-native).
